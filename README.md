# What is this?
This is a Python application that uses ttkboostrap to create the GUI. Users can enter an image of a receipt, the total amount spent, and the date of that purchase.

Once users have finished entering the expense information, they have the option to continue adding as much as they like to have all their expenses viewable at a glance!

Users may also click on the receipt image to open up a pop-up window for a better view of that receipt. 

# The Set Up
1) Ensure that you pip installed the following:
   * ttkboostrap
   * typing
   * PIL
2) Adjust the theme of the app, button colors, and fonts by changing values in `settings.py`
3) Either run the python file through an IDE of your choice OR run it via CMD prompt with `python bought.py` 

# Credits
Thanks to Clear Code for guiding the process of allowing users to upload images and displaying that image on a ttk Canvas. Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/mop6g-c5HEY?si=NNGBttziY8uU8Yeq&t=56780)! 

**NOTE:** This app was created for the sole purpose of gaining more experience with ttkboostrap and Python, as well as to have fun coding. This is not an officially deployed app.
